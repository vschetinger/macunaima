                    <h2>About Macunaíma</h2>
                    <p>Macunaíma is a character from Brazilian literature, known for his cunning, laziness, and cleverness. He embodies many aspects of our project: like Macunaíma, our generative models are capable of producing a wide variety of stories and narratives, and like his parrot, they store and recombine ideas to create something new.</p>

            <h2>Our Project</h2>
            <p>We aim to harness the power of generative models to create audiovisual narratives. Our system, named after the mythical Macunaíma, strives to generate compelling and diverse narratives in a way that's as unpredictable and creative as its namesake.</p>
