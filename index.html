                <h2>About Macunaíma</h2>
                Introducing Macunaíma—the enigmatic hero without a character, a creation from Brazilian literature that transcends the boundary between man and myth. Birthed in Mário de Andrade's imagination, Macunaíma is a trickster who embodies the cultural diversity of Brazil and navigates through society with sharp wit and irreverent humor. His loyal parrot, a symbol of narrative reinterpretation and oral tradition, serves as the logo for our exploration.
            <br><br>
            In the crossroads of literature, artificial intelligence, and storytelling, Macunaíma's spirit guides this unique journey. Generative AI models, synthesizing language, imagery, and ideas, create vibrant narratives akin to the Dadaist's avant-garde explorations.
            <br><br>
            Yet these narratives reflect the AI's paradoxical nature—much like Macunaíma himself. They mirror our expectations and echo our imagination, drawing us into the realm of Umberto Eco's semiotics.
            <br><br>
            This transformative process redefines the concept of 'The Open Work', a notion put forth by Eco. Here, narratives remain perpetually unfinished, their meanings co-constructed by the creator and the receiver, blurring the boundary between artist and audience.
            <br><br>
            This exploration invites challenge, welcomes the unexpected, and dares to dream beyond the known. Thus, the narrative of Macunaíma unfolds—celebrating the ethics, aesthetics, and poetics of artificial intelligence in an era of rapid transformation.

            <h2>Our Project</h2>
            <p>We aim to harness the power of generative models to create audiovisual narratives. Our system, named after the mythical Macunaíma, strives to generate compelling and diverse narratives in a way that's as unpredictable and creative as its namesake.</p>
