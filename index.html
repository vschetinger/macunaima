                <h2>Macunaíma</h2>
                <p>Introducing Macunaíma—an enigmatic creation from Brazilian literature that transcends the boundary between man and myth. Birthed in Mário de Andrade's imagination, Macunaíma navigates through society with sharp wit and irreverent humor. His loyal parrot, a symbol of narrative reinterpretation and oral tradition, serves as the logo for our exploration.</p>

            <h2>Artificial Intelligence and Storytelling</h2>
            <p>In the crossroads of literature, artificial intelligence, and storytelling, Macunaíma's spirit guides this unique journey. Generative AI models, synthesizing language, imagery, and ideas, create vibrant narratives akin to the Dadaist's avant-garde explorations. These narratives, much like Macunaíma, mirror our expectations and echo our imagination.</p>
            <p>Entering the realm of semiotics, Umberto Eco's influence becomes apparent. His narrative style, reminiscent of Macunaíma's blend of myth and reality, is embodied in works like 'Baudolino'. Stories in both 'Baudolino' and Macunaíma's own journey intertwine fantasy with history, creating rich, unpredictable narratives.</p>
            <p>In this exploration, we're not just adopting Eco's narrative style, we're also bringing back his concept of 'The Open Work'. Here, narratives remain perpetually unfinished, their meanings co-constructed by the creator and the receiver, blurring the boundary between artist and audience.</p>

            <h2>Our Project</h2>
            <p>Born from the HumaneAI network—an EU consortium for developing humane artificial intelligence—our project marries generative models with storytelling. Initiated by Rudolf Rosa, from Charles University Prague, and Victor Schetinger, from TU Wien, it has since expanded to include a diverse team of collaborators.</p>
            <p>We're exploring the generation of stories, audiovisual content, and the various humanistic and technical challenges that arise. With a prototype in place, we're gearing up for experiments and public testings. As we move forward, we stay true to our ethos—celebrating the ethics, aesthetics, and poetics of artificial intelligence in an era of rapid transformation.</p>
